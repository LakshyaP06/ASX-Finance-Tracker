# ASX-Finance-Tracker
Top ASXs based on growth and stability tracker.
The ASX Finance Tracker is an innovative application designed to aid users in identifying optimal ASX investments. Leveraging data scraped from Yahoo Finance, the application analyzes and evaluates ASX stocks based on two key variables: five-year growth potential and overall stability. The results are visually represented through interactive graphs, offering clear insights into performance trends. As the first prototype, the application showcases a preliminary algorithm for ranking ASX stocks, with planned enhancements to improve accuracy and reliability in future iterations. Additionally, the application includes a feature that enables users to download the analysis as a .csv file, providing a convenient way to access and utilize the tabulated results offline.
